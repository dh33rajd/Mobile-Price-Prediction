# Mobile-Price-Prediction

Given the different specifications of various mobiles, this project aims to predict a price range for
mobile phones. The price range can be classified into four categories: cheap, moderate, economical
and expensive, i.e. 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively. We want to estimate the price range for the mobiles
given in the test data.
